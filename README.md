Microsoft Power BI Dashboards
This Power BI Report is created to track the performance of different countries during Olympic games from 1896 to 2016. 
One can see the performance of a country based on yearly, country wise, games wise or medals won. 
And the dasboard displays the results acordingly and ranks the countries' performanc on the bar graph.
